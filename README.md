A simple billing system project in C# is designed to streamline the process of generating and managing customer bills for a small business. This application allows users to add, edit, and remove items or services, apply quantities and prices, and calculate totals automatically. Typically, it includes a user-friendly interface where the user can input item details, view an itemized bill, apply taxes or discounts, and generate a final bill summary. The system may also store customer information, allowing for quick access to billing history and enabling repeat transactions. By automating calculations and organizing billing records, the project simplifies billing workflows, reduces human error, and enhances record-keeping for business transactions.
